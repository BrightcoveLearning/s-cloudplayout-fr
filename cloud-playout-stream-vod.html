    <p>To create a new Cloud Playout channel, follow these steps. </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Click <strong>Cloud Playout</strong> in the navigation header.</li>
      <li>
        Click <span class="button-blue">Add New</span>:
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Identification</strong> details:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name</strong> - Name for the channel. The name must have English characters and the following special characters are allowed:   _ . : / = + - </li>
          <li><strong>Description</strong> - Channel description</li>
          <li><strong>Image URL</strong> - URL to an image file for the channel; meant to be a channel image that could be retrieved as part of the channel's metadata</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Schedule</strong> details.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: the channel is created in the timezone of the user who creates it. If you will be deploying the channel in a region that has a different timezone, you will need to adjust the schedule for the difference between the two timezones.</aside>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> - If <strong>On</strong>, the program will be played in a loop and the <strong>End Date/Time</strong> will be enabled. The program can still be modified at any time and the changes will be reflected in the current program and the loops to follow. See the <a href="#looping">Creating a looping program</a> section below.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad Insertion</strong> - If on, allows ads to be displayed during channel playback. If this option is selected, you can only output to a <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> or <strong>Amazon S3 Bucket</strong>. See <a href="{{ site.cloud_playout_path }}enabling-server-side-ads.html">Monetizing Content</a>.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start Date/Time</strong> - Time when the channel will start playing out. The start time for all assets will be calculated by adding their duration to this start time. This time can be updated only when the channel is not in running state.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Note: it takes 1-2 minutes for the initial startup of a channel, so if the start is time-sensitive, schedule it for 2 minutes before the time you want to initiate playback.</aside>
          </li>
          <li><strong>End Date/Time</strong> - If no value is entered and <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is not selected, the stream will end once the playout is complete. If <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is selected and there is no <strong>End Date/Time</strong>, the playout will be streamed until the channel is stopped. This time can be updated at any time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you will be using Live inputs, set <strong>Live Input</strong> to On, and enter a Slate URL, unless you are going to use the default Brightcove MP4 for you slate. The slate MP4 will play whenever Live input is stopped because the encoder is stopped or some technical issue blocks the live stream. <strong>Note that <strong>the Slate URL must be a static URL that is always available</strong> (short-lived CDN URLs are not allowed).</strong></li>
      <li>
        Import closed captions is enabled by default; if you do not want to import captions, disable it now or while the channel is in DRAFT state:

        Enter the channel <strong>Destination</strong> details. For channels to work in {{ site.product_short }} apps, you must select <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> as the destination.
        {% endif %}
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Optimize Display for</strong> - Controls the bitrate and dimensions for the output
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mobile &amp; Web</strong> - If checked, HD Output (RTMP or HLS single bitrate)</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> - Create or use a previously created Brightcove Live Channel. When creating a new channel, the region of the channel will be optimized based upon the <strong>Output Region</strong> that was selected.

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">This section only applies if you are including live events in your channel.</aside>
    <p>For your live encoder, you will need the RTMP ingest point for your channel. You can find it in the <strong>:Channel Settings</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-cloudplayout-img/cloudplayout-rtmp-ingest-point.png" alt="Ingest Point">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Ingest Point</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">
      Please note that Cloud Playout uses a CNAME mapping for the ingest point but in rare cases this mapping may not be complete and the channel may temporarily show an IP Address. Check the channel settings before starting a live stream to the channel and wait until the Ingest Point shows a CNAME if you see an IP address such as the one below:
      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/ingest-point-ip-address.png" alt="Ingest Point with IP Address">
        <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Ingest Point with IP Address</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </aside>

    <p>Depending on the encoder you are using, you may need to enter both the RTMP ingest point and the stream name. The stream name for the channel is the <strong>Channel ID</strong>, which is also the last part of the Ingest Point address.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that if you are using the OBS software encoder, you will need to specify a <strong>Custom...</strong> service, and will need to input a <strong>Server</strong> and <strong>Stream Key</strong>. The <strong>Server</strong> will be the first part of the <strong>Ingest Point</strong>, and the <strong>Steam Key</strong> will be the remaining part, as shown in the example below:

    <p>To create a program that loops, when creating the channel, set the <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> setting to <strong>On</strong>. As videos are added to the program, the program listing will update to display the series of videos with associated start/end times to fill the entire channel scheduled time. When you change the duration of a live event, the duration of events that have already passed will remain unchanged, but any future plays of the event will use the new duration.</p>
